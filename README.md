##"Black Hat Python" Source Code
Source code for the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz (No Starch Press). The code has been fully converted to Python 3 and reformatted to comply with PEP8 standards. The basic logic and functionality of the code has been left unaltered.

Although many optimizations could be implemented in the source code presented
throughout the book, the code is left unaltered as much as possible so that
such implementations can be applied by the reader as he sees fit.

- Some listings were missing from the Author's code repository and were
added to their respective chapters. A more accurate naming convention has
been applied to the files as necessary in order to relate them to the code
presented in the book.
- Minor bugs have been fixed throughout the code without altering its
characteristics.
